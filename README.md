# 🚀 Relay — Franchise Management System

**A production-ready franchise management platform built with React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS on the frontend and Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite on the backend. Supports four distinct user roles with end-to-end RBAC enforcement, royalty configuration, financial reporting with PDF export, expense tracking, product catalog management, inventory tracking with recipe-based stock deductions, branch lifecycle management, and database-backed file storage — all in a zero-database-server setup.**

## ⚡ Quick Start

👉 **[START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** — Complete startup guide from a fresh laptop boot. No database server required.

🧪 **[TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md)** — Exhaustive manual feature testing checklist covering all 4 roles, RBAC, edge cases, and PDF verification.

## 🌟 What Is Relay?

Relay is a complete franchise operations ecosystem. It models the full hierarchy from brand owner down to shop-floor staff, enforcing role-based access at every layer:

| Role | Who They Are | What They Can Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Franchisor** | Brand owner | Review applications, manage network, configure royalty, run reports, manage product catalog & recipes, toggle branch status, upload menus |
| **Branch Owner** | Franchisee | Manage their branch, appoint manager, view performance, manage staff lifecycle, approve/reject stock requests, log expenses, generate branch reports with PDF export |
| **Manager** | Branch operations lead | Oversee stock, add inventory items, record deliveries, record multi-product sales, submit purchase requests, manage staff, log expenses |
| **Staff** | Shop-floor employee | Record sales, view inventory, record deliveries |

## ✨ Feature Catalogue

### 🔐 Authentication & RBAC

- JWT-based authentication (custom HS256 implementation using HMAC-SHA256 — no third-party JWT library); JWT signing consolidated with Flask `SECRET_KEY`
- Two principal types: `Franchisor` (brand account) and `User` (all branch roles)
- `token_required` decorator enforces role allow-lists on every protected endpoint
- Inactive user check enforced at the token layer — deactivated accounts receive `403` immediately
- Password strength validation on all registration and reset flows (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Forced password reset on first login for system-created accounts (Managers & Staff)
- Persistent auth state via `AuthContext` with auto-logout on `401` or expired token
- Token expiry check on frontend — expired tokens trigger automatic logout
- Login rate limiting via `Flask-Limiter` (5 attempts per minute per IP)
- Request timeouts — all frontend API calls abort after 15 seconds via `AbortController`
- Forgot password modal on login page with support contact info

### 📋 Franchise Application Workflow

- Public 11-field registration form: personal details, franchise brand, preferred branch location, property size, investment capacity, prior business experience, supporting document upload
- Separate Franchisor registration form for brand owners
- Applications land in `PENDING` state; routed to `PendingDashboard` until reviewed
- Franchisor reviews via modal with full applicant detail and document viewer
- One-click **Approve** — creates branch, assigns branch owner role automatically
- **Reject with reason** — structured rejection modal (minimum 10-character reason enforced client and server side)
- Application status badges: `PENDING` (yellow), `APPROVED` (green), `REJECTED` (red)
- Pending applications count shown as badge on the Applications tab

### 🏢 Branch Network Management (Franchisor)

- Network tab shows all branches across all franchises in a sortable table
- Per-branch columns: Branch Name, Franchise, Location, Owner, Manager, Status badge
- **Branch status toggle:** Franchisor can activate or deactivate any branch with a confirmation dialog
  - Status badge turns green (ACTIVE) or gray (INACTIVE)
  - Toggle button flips label: "Deactivate" ↔ "Activate"
  - Backend enforces franchise ownership at the branch resolver level — all cross-franchise access returns `403`
- Menu file upload per franchise (PDF/image) with 5MB file-size limit
- Files stored as binary blobs in the database (no filesystem dependency)

### 📦 Product Catalog (Franchisor)

- **Stock Items:** Define raw ingredients/materials with name, unit, description, and reorder threshold
- **Product Categories:** Organise menu items into named groups; duplicate name guard enforced
- **Products:** Create sellable items with name, category, description, and price; edit and toggle active/inactive status
- **Recipes:** Link products to stock items with quantity-per-unit (e.g. "Cappuccino uses 18g Coffee Beans")
  - Add/remove ingredients inline
  - Recipe view shows all current ingredients per product
- **Stock Item Usage:** View which products use a given stock item via "View Products" button
- All catalog changes cascade to branch inventory and sales automatically

### 🏪 Branch Inventory Management

- Per-branch inventory tracks current quantity for every stock item
- Low-stock detection: items at or below `reorder_level` trigger a persistent, dismissible amber banner visible on all tabs (Manager & Staff dashboards)
- Low-stock rows highlighted with amber background color
- **Add Inventory Item:** Manager can add stock items to branch inventory with initial quantity and reorder level; duplicate item guard prevents re-adding
- **Record Delivery:** Staff and Manager log incoming stock with quantity and notes — updates inventory instantly; row briefly pulses on update
- **Stock Purchase Requests:** Manager submits requests with item, quantity, and estimated unit cost; Branch Owner approves or rejects
  - Request status flow: `PENDING` → `APPROVED` / `REJECTED`
  - Approved requests automatically update branch inventory
  - Pending request count shown as badge on the Requests tab
- **Recipe-based stock deduction:** Sales automatically deduct ingredient quantities based on product recipes
- **Insufficient stock guard:** Sales are rejected server-side if any ingredient is below the required quantity

### 💰 Sales Tracking

- Staff and Managers record individual sales with: product(s), quantity, unit price, payment mode (Cash/Card/UPI), and timestamp
- **Multi-product sales:** Add multiple products per sale using "+ Add Product" button; total is sum of all line items
- Sales history table shows all past transactions per branch with correct date/time and payment mode
- Manager sees own branch sales; Franchisor sees aggregated data in reports
- Timestamps shown with IST timezone formatting (Asia/Kolkata)

### 💸 Expense Tracking

- Branch Owners and Managers can log expenses with: category, date, amount, and optional description
- **9 expense categories:** Rent, Utilities, Salaries, Supplies, Maintenance, Marketing, Insurance, Transport, Other
- Expenses table shows logged-by name, category, date, amount, and delete option
- Amount validation: must be positive numeric value; negative amounts are rejected
- Expenses are scoped to branch — cross-branch access is prevented
- Expenses are included in monthly financial reports under the Expense Breakdown section

### 👥 Staff Management

**Branch Owner Dashboard — My Staff Tab**
- Full staff table with Name, Email, Status badge, and Actions column
- **Branch Manager section** and **Support Staff table** displayed separately
- **Appoint Manager:** If no manager exists, Branch Owner can create one via modal (name, email, phone, temporary password)
- **Add Staff (Manager):** Manager can add new staff members with name, email, phone, and temporary password
- **Deactivate staff:** Branch owner can deactivate any Manager or Staff member
  - Confirmation dialog before action
  - Deactivated row: Name and Email cells dim to `opacity-50`; Status badge turns gray "Inactive"
  - Deactivated users cannot log in (enforced at token layer — returns `403`)
- **Reactivate staff:** Reactivate button shown clearly at full opacity (not dimmed) for inactive rows
  - Confirmation dialog before action
  - Row returns to normal appearance; Status badge turns green "Active"
- Branch owners cannot deactivate themselves or other branch owners (enforced backend + hidden in UI)
- **Force Reset Password:** Branch Owner or Manager can trigger a forced password reset for any staff member; user is prompted to change password on next login

### 💎 Royalty Configuration (Franchisor)

- Configure royalty as a **percentage split** between franchisor and branch owner (percentages sum to 100%)
- Effective date tracking per configuration version
- **Royalty Summary:** Franchisor can query any month/year to see:
  - Total sales per branch
  - Franchisor earned amount and Branch Owner earned amount per branch
  - Cut % per branch
- Branch owners see their own royalty earnings on the Overview tab ("Royalty Earned MTD") and in the Reports tab
